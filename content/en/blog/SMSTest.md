  ## Possibility of sending >=50 messages either as a segment or as single SMS message units. 

SMS or "Short Message Service," refers to standard text messages that are sent using a cellular signal instead of an internet connection. They are an easy means of offline communication. 

SMS service is used by 74% of mobile users around the world.
SMS messages are limited to 160 characters, which is why longer SMS messages are typically broken into segments. 

Since SMS messages are  designed to be short, Afkanerd set out to carry out a research on finding out how many message segments can be sent successfully in one long message. 

The segments here refer to the number of messages broken down into 140 character groups each,
For example 280 characters makes 2 segments. We are finding out the success rate(message was received by recipient) or the failure rate(message was not received by recipient) for the segments of each message sent, and the success/failure rates of sending messages as a single text simultaneously.

The goal of the research is to know how many segments can be delivered successfully in one message.  We did this experiment using the orange unlimited text message  bundle.
